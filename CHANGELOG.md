## [0.2.3]

- Removed the old example images for now as they do not represet the theme colors at all at this point.
  - I will update this soon so that people at least have a preview.
  - At least know that, the colors on the icons are the main colors represented by this theme.
- Swapped quite a few colors and tried to make it overall more enjoyable to read.
- Converted some images to webp file format for reduced file size.
- ~~Added new theme example images to show the current look and not the initial.~~ (Was too busy to complete the example images, colors have switched a lot, but all the same colors are still in use.)
- ~~Updated README.md with more info.~~ (Could not complete this as of yet)
- Changed some colors that were too dark to see correctly.
- Added a ton of languages to my testing folder and started adding tokens of the languages I will support with this theme.
  - Note that theme will have a high focus on CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Go, Lua, Wikitextâ€¦
  - However I will try my best to support all sorts of popular languages, but it will be limited.

## [0.2.2]

- Changed foreground text color to light grey for all text except markdown text.
  - Maybe let me know if you prefer a less flashy green for markdown text as well.
- Removed red color from wikitext, and finetuned wikitext a little.
- Added a sidebar border, as I found it difficult to find and move the sidebar.
- Added new red error color that is more in line with the theme colors.
- Changed selected text highlighting to a less transparent purple.

## [0.2.1]

- Some minor changes to README.md

## [0.2.0]

- Renamed *cfl-one-color-theme.json* to *cfl-one.json*
- Reorganized entire cfl-one.json file:
  - [x] No more duplicate tokenColors and duplicate entries.
  - [x] All tokens organized into arrays, much easier to manage.
  - [x] 1100+ lines of code delet in cfl-one.json
- Mostly worked on CSS, only some adjustments to Wikitext and JS
- I'm aware that right now wikitext syntax is very wild, I will be toning this down a little, however it will stay vibrant, but it shouldn't be nauseating as is the case right now.
- Made and added new Logo and Icon.
