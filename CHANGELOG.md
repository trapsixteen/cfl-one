## [0.2.1]

- Some minor changes to README.md

## [0.2.0]

- Renamed *cfl-one-color-theme.json* to *cfl-one.json*
- Reorganized entire cfl-one.json file:
  - [x] No more duplicate tokenColors and duplicate entries.
  - [x] All tokens organized into arrays, much easier to manage.
  - [x] 1100+ lines of code delet in cfl-one.json
- Mostly worked on CSS, only some adjustments to Wikitext and JS
- I'm aware that right now wikitext syntax is very wild, I will be toning this down a little, however it will stay vibrant, but it shouldn't be nauseating as is the case right now.
- Made and added new Logo and Icon.
