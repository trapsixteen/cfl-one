## [0.2.2]

- Changed foreground text color to light grey for all text except markdown text.
  - Maybe let me know if you prefer a less flashy green for markdown text as well.
- Removed red color from wikitext, and finetuned wikitext a little.
- Added a sidebar border, as I found it difficult to find and move the sidebar.
- Added new red error color that is more in line with the theme colors.
- Changed selected text highlighting to a less transparent purple.

## [0.2.1]

- Some minor changes to README.md

## [0.2.0]

- Renamed *cfl-one-color-theme.json* to *cfl-one.json*
- Reorganized entire cfl-one.json file:
  - [x] No more duplicate tokenColors and duplicate entries.
  - [x] All tokens organized into arrays, much easier to manage.
  - [x] 1100+ lines of code delet in cfl-one.json
- Mostly worked on CSS, only some adjustments to Wikitext and JS
- I'm aware that right now wikitext syntax is very wild, I will be toning this down a little, however it will stay vibrant, but it shouldn't be nauseating as is the case right now.
- Made and added new Logo and Icon.
